Syslog Agents run on <%= vars.platform_name %> VMs to collect and forward logs to configured syslog drains. You can specify the destination for logs when defining the individual syslog drain bound to an application or in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> configuration for all apps in your foundation as an aggregate drain. You can also set the drain scope. Any VM running a syslog agent may connect to configured syslog drains: including Diego Cells, Routers, and Cloud Controllers.
